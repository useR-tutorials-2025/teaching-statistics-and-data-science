Shorter is better than longer.\n\n‚Äì Avoid words with special meaning in programming (e.g. NA).\n\n## Outline\n\n::::: columns\n::: {.column width=\"50%\"}\nWhat is Git and GitHub?\n\nWhy do we care about it?\n\nWhy should we use it?\n\n```         \n  - student perspective \n  \n  - instructor perspective\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.column width=\"50%\"}\n![](images/github.png){fig-align=\"left\"}\n:::\n:::::\n\n## Git and GitHub: Teaching Termonilogy\n\nOften used interchangeably, but it's nice to know the difference...\n\nGit is a version control system that intelligently tracks changes in files.\n\nGitHub is a cloud-based platform where you can store, share, and work together with others to write code.\n\nThink of this as email (Git) vs Gmail (GitHub)\n\n## GitHub: Version control {.smaller}\n\nGitHub allows you to create, store, change, merge, and collaborate on files or code. Any member of a team can access the GitHub repository and see the most recent version in real-time. Then, they can make edits or changes that the other collaborators also see.\n\nGitHub also lets users make requests of one another and internally discuss the iterations along the way.\n\n[What is Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-What-is-Git%3F)\n\n## GitHub: Version control\n\n![](images/version.png)\n\n## Why does this matter\n\n::: footer\nBaker, M. 1,500 scientists lift the lid on reproducibility.
