We will discuss pedagogy and curriculum design for effectively teaching computing alongside statistical concepts. Participants will explore example in-class activities and assignments that demonstrate the student experience, while discussing strategies for implementing such activities from the instructor perspective. We will also discuss computing infrastructure options that enable students to use R and Rstudio from a web browser with minimal set up. Lastly, we will show how instructors can use R and Quarto to make course materials and streamline their workflow in a reproducible way using GitHub. The tutorial will focus on teaching introductory-level undergraduate students with no previous computing experience, but the tutorial content is applicable for instructors teaching high school courses and courses throughout the undergraduate statistics and data science curriculum.",

There will be time during our scheduled break to create an account. However, if you’d like to do this before the workshop starts, please do so! See the steps below.\n\nGo to github.com, and create an account (unless you already have one).\nCreate a username. Some tips on creating a username Happy Git and GitHub for the useR include…\n\nIncorporate your actual name!\nReuse your username from other contexts if you can, e. g., Twitter or Slack.\nBe as unique as possible in as few characters as possible. Shorter is better than longer.\nAvoid words with special meaning in programming (e.g. NA).",
