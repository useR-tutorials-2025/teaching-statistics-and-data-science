We will discuss pedagogy and curriculum design for effectively teaching computing alongside statistical concepts. Participants will explore example in-class activities and assignments that demonstrate the student experience, while discussing strategies for implementing such activities from the instructor perspective. We will also discuss computing infrastructure options that enable students to use R and Rstudio from a web browser with minimal set up. Lastly, we will show how instructors can use R and Quarto to make course materials and streamline their workflow in a reproducible way using GitHub. The tutorial will focus on teaching introductory-level undergraduate students with no previous computing experience, but the tutorial content is applicable for instructors teaching high school courses and courses throughout the undergraduate statistics and data science curriculum. ## Learning goals\n\nLearn pedagogical strategies for teaching R and GitHub in a statistics or data science course\nIdentify how computing can be integrated alongside statistical concepts in a course curriculu\nExperience computing activities and assignments from both the student and instructor perspective\nConsider the computing infrastructure that may be the best fit for your student population\nLearn how to develop course materials with R and Quarto and develop a reproducible workflow with GitHub",

Using library() around the pacakge name opens up the package for us to use the functions inside!\n\n\nData\nThe data are stored as a CSV (comma separated values) file in the data folder of your repository. Let’s read it from there and save it as an object called bechdel.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThis a modified version of the bechdel dataset from the previous application exercise. It’s been modified to include some new variables derived from existing variables as well as to limit the scope of the data to movies released between 1990 and 2013.\n\n\n\n\nGet to know the data\nWe can use the glimpse function to get an overview (or “glimpse”) of the data. Write the following code below to accomplish this task.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nWith your output, confirm that:\n– There are 1615 rows\n– There are 7 variables (columns) in the dataset\nWe can use slice to look at rows of our data. Run the following code. Change the 5 to another number to print that many rows!\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nWhat does each observation (row) in the data set represent?\nAnswer: \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolution\n\n\n\n\n\nEach observation represents a movie."
