# Curriculum

## A modern approach

-   Modern approach to teaching statistics and now the onset of data science

-   How is this different from the traditional approach - the computing is infused throughout

-   Bring in curriculum guidelines - what they are saying about computing

## Intro Data Science

![Image from [Data Science in a Box](https://datasciencebox.org)](images/ds-topics.png){fig-align="center"}

## Intro Data Science topics

**Unit 1: Exploring data**

-   Data visualization 
-   Exploring multivariable relationships

## Tidyverse

*The tidyverse is an opinionated [**collection of R packages**](https://www.tidyverse.org/packages) designed for data science. All packages share an underlying design philosophy, grammar, and data structures.*

## Pedagogical benefits of the tidyverse

-   **Consistency**: Syntax, function interfaces, argument names and order follow patterns

-   **Mixability**: Ability to use base R and other functions within tidyverse syntax

-   **Scalability**: Unified approach that works for data sets from a wide range of types and sizes

-   **User-centered design**: Function interfaces designed with users in mind

-   **Readability**: Interfaces designed to produce readable code

-   **Community**: Large, active, and welcoming community of users and resources

-   **Transferability**: Data manipulation verbs inherit SQL's query syntax

## Tidy data

1.  Each variable forms a column.
2.  Each observation forms a row.
3.  Each type of observational unit forms a table.

## The pipe

The **pipe,** `|>`, is used to pass information from one function to another in the tidyverse.

. . .

When reading code aloud in English, say "and then" whenever you see a pipe.

. . .

Below is a pipeline describing a typical morning.

. . .

```         
 find("keys") |>
  start_car() |>
  drive(to = "work") |>
  park()
```

## Data: Palmer penguins {.midi}

We will analyze the `penguins` data set from the [**palmerpenguins** R package](https://allisonhorst.github.io/palmerpenguins/) maintained by Dr. Allison Horst. This data set contains measurements and other characteristics for penguins observed near Palmer Station in Antarctica. The data were originally collected by Dr. Kristen Gorman.

We will use the following variables:

-   `species`: a factor denoting penguin species (Adélie, Chinstrap and Gentoo)
-   `flipper_length_mm`: an integer denoting flipper length (millimeters)
-   `body_mass_g`: an integer denoting body mass (grams)

[Click here](https://allisonhorst.github.io/palmerpenguins/reference/penguins.html) for the full codebook.

## `penguins` data frame

```{r}
library(palmerpenguins)
penguins
```

## Base R: Compute summary statistics

::: question
Compute the mean flipper length for Palmer penguins.
:::

```{r}
penguins
```

. . .

```{r}
mean(penguins$flipper_length_mm, na.rm = TRUE)
```

## Base R: Compute summary statistics {.midi}

::: question
For each species, compute the number of penguins and the mean flipper length. Display the results in descending order by number of penguins.
:::

. . .

**Compute number of penguins by species**

```{r}
num_penguins <- aggregate(flipper_length_mm ~ species, data = penguins, FUN = length)
names(num_penguins)[2] <- "num_penguins"
```

. . .

**Compute mean flipper length by species**

```{r}
mean_flipper <- aggregate(flipper_length_mm ~ species, data = penguins, FUN = mean)

names(mean_flipper)[2] <- "mean_flipper_length"

```

## Base R: Compute summary statistics {.midi}

::: question
For each species, compute the number of penguins and the mean flipper length. Display the results in descending order by number of penguins.
:::

**Combine results and sort data frame**

```{r}
df <- merge(num_penguins, mean_flipper)
df[order(df$num_penguins, decreasing = TRUE), ]

```

## Tidyverse: Compute summary statistics

-   Redo the example using tidyverse

<!--# Note that example is inspired by educators paper and DS in the classroom workshop-->

## Your turn!

::: question
-   Create a new data frame that only contains the penguin from each species with the largest body mass.

<!-- -->

-   **\[Time permitting\]** Use [**dplyr**](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/index.html) functions to continue exploring the `penguins` data set.

## Tidyverse beyond the intro course

## Quote from tidyverse paper?

-   Educator's guide to the tidyverse

## What about AI?

-   We recommend minimal use of generative artificial intelligence (AI) for coding when coding proficiency is a learning objective in an introductory course

-   We will not cover generative AI in this tutorial

-   There are a variety of perspectives on using generative AI tools to teaching coding:

    -   Bien, J., & Mukherjee, G. (2025). [Generative AI for Data Science 101: Coding Without Learning To Code](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/26939169.2024.2432397?src=exp-mr). *Journal of Statistics and Data Science Education*, *33*(2), 129-142.

## Discussion

::: question
-   What is something you've seen thus far that you find exciting? Want to learn more about? Would like to incorporate in your teaching?

-   Any other questions/ comments/ discussion points?

# Infrastructure

## Web-based computing

-   Why use web-based computing rather than local install

    -   local R/ RStudio

    -   Posit Cloud

    -   Docker containers with RStudio license / NC Share

## Docker containers

-   Infrastructure options

-   Brief introduction to Quarto (like an R Markdown file)

-   Make a qmd file . Render it.

-   Turn the qmd into a web-r file.
