## Signing up for GitHub

Go to https://github.com/, and create an account (unless you already have one).

Some tips from Happy Git with R.

‚Äì Incorporate your actual name!

‚Äì Reuse your username from other contexts if you can, e. g., Twitter or Slack.

‚Äì Pick a username you will be comfortable revealing to your future boss.

‚Äì Be as unique as possible in as few characters as possible. Shorter is better than longer.

‚Äì Avoid words with special meaning in programming (e.g. NA).

What is Git and GitHub?

Why do we care about it?

Why should we use it?

## Git and GitHub: Teaching Termonilogy

Often used interchangeably, but it's nice to know the difference...

Git is a version control system that intelligently tracks changes in files.

GitHub is a cloud-based platform where you can store, share, and work together with others to write code.

Think of this as email (Git) vs Gmail (GitHub)

## GitHub: Version control {.smaller}

GitHub allows you to create, store, change, merge, and collaborate on files or code. Any member of a team can access the GitHub repository and see the most recent version in real-time. Then, they can make edits or changes that the other collaborators also see.

GitHub also lets users make requests of one another and internally discuss the iterations along the way.

# So we should teach it!

## What do students immediately get out of it?

Besides saving the world....

-   develop good habits as researchers

-   emphasize the importance of reproducibility in science

That is timeless across semesters

## Timeless

Encourages time investment into the creation of assessments and lesson plans

-- Easily transferable across semesters

-- Hosting assessments on GitHub provides the ability to eÔ¨Äiciently manage, update, and re-use materials for subsequent semesters

**especially useful in large class sizes**

## in-class activities

Within personalized student repos, we can provide template code and other resources necessary to best facilitate an interactive lesson

## Steps for interactive lessons

-- Connect GitHub and R/Rstudio

-- Take advantage of GitHub as an instructor to create an assignment in GitHub we can distribute to our class

## lab-0 / day-2

Getting students set up

We are going to connect GitHub and R/Rstudio together!

[instructions](https://st295.github.io/st295-sp25/ae-sa/github-config-post.html)

## Instructor logistics

-- Make a free [GitHub Organization](github.com/organizations/new)

-- [Request teacher benefits](education.github.com/discount)

-- Upgrade your organization with GitHub Classroom

-- Make the assignment

-- Distribute the assignment

## GitHub Organization

A GitHub organization is a shared account on GitHub that allows multiple users to collaborate on shared projects, making it easier for teams to work together

```         
  -   owners can control who has access to repositories and other resources within the organization
  -   keeps student repos private by default
  -   allow for the creation of teams
  -   allows us to work with GitHub classroom features (ex. distributing assignments)
  
  
```
