-   Create a username. Some tips on creating a username from *Happy Git and GitHub for the useR* include…

    1.  Incorporate your actual name!
    2.  Reuse your username from other contexts if you can, e. g., Twitter or Slack.
    3.  Be as unique as possible in as few characters as possible. Shorter is better than longer.
    4.  Avoid words with special meaning in programming (e.g. NA).
