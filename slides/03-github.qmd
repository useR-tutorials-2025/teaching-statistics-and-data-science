What is git and GitHub?

Why do we care about it?

Why should we use it?

## git and GitHub: Teaching termonilogy

Often used interchangeably, but it's nice to know the difference...

Git is a version control system that intelligently tracks changes in files.

GitHub is a cloud-based platform where you can store, share, and work together with others to write code.

Think of this as email (git) vs Gmail (GitHub)

## GitHub: Version control

GitHub allows you to create, store, change, merge, and collaborate on files or code. Any member of a team can access the GitHub repository and see the most recent version in real-time. Then, they can make edits or changes that the other collaborators also see.

<br>

GitHub also lets users make requests of one another and internally discuss the iterations along the way.

# So we should teach it!

## What do students immediately get out of it?

Besides saving the world....

-   develop good habits as researchers

-   emphasize the importance of reproducibility in science

-   get experience using professional computing tools

## Avoid this

## Gain this

## What do you get?

Efficient way to run a course

-   lecutres

-   in-class activities

-   assessments

## What do you get?

Efficient way to run a course

-   lecutres

-   in-class activities

-   assessments

That is timeless across semesters

## Timeless

Encourages time investment into the creation of assessments and lesson plans

-   Easily transferable across semesters

-   Hosting assessments on GitHub provides the ability to eÔ¨Äiciently manage, update, and re-use materials for subsequent semesters

## What do you get?

Efficient way to run a course

-   lecutres

-   in-class activities

-   assessments

especially useful in large class sizes

## Personalized student repos

Within personalized student repos, we can facilitate an interactive lesson for each student + have them practice using version control

## Steps for interactive lessons

-   Connect GitHub and R/RStudio

-   Take advantage of GitHub as an instructor to create an assignment in GitHub we can distribute to our class

## Connect GitHub and R/RStudio

... often done on the first lab / second day of class

Help create the ability for students to practice with version control

**Demo together:** Please use your assigned Docker URL to access R/RStudio

We are going to connect GitHub and R/RStudio together using lab instructions below!

# Instructor perspective

## Instructor logistics

-   Make a free [GitHub Organization](github.com/organizations/new)

-   [Request teacher benefits](education.github.com/discount)

-   Upgrade your organization with GitHub Classroom

-   Make the assignment

-   Distribute the assignment

## GitHub organization

A GitHub organization is a shared account on GitHub that allows multiple users to collaborate on shared projects, making it easier for teams to work together

-   owners can control who has access to repositories and other resources within the organization
-   keeps student repos private by default
-   allow for the creation of teams
-   allows us to work with GitHub classroom features (ex. distributing assignments)

## Inside your GitHub Organization

üìç [useR-org-demo](https://github.com/useR-org-demo/my-class)

my-class repository

üìÇ - slides

üìÇ - homework

üìÇ - in-class-activities

... and you can make other repos within the organization to distribute!

## Inside your GitHub organization

Let's demo

-   Creating a GitHub repo inside the org

-   Basic GitHub workflow within a repo

-   Create an assignment

-   Distribute it to your class

## How to distribute a assignment

[GitHub Classroom](https://classroom.github.com/classrooms)

## Accept the assignment yourself!

[assignment](https://classroom.github.com/a/S-N-TQ7U)

Or go to our website and click the `demo-assignment` link.

-   Accept the assignment

-   Clone the repo

-   Make changes

-   Push the changes back to GitHub

## Cloning instructions
